# Squalomix - shark genomics and beyond

## What is 'Squalomix'?
Our project Squalomix aims at unveiling the unique evolutionary trajectory of sharks and rays and is sustained by tight collaborations involving an academic sequencing core facility and multiple public aquariums. By means of multimodal omics and molecular evolutionary approaches, it tackles various biological questions including morphological evolution, sensory systems, and reproduction including sex determination. The project overview is presented in [this introductory movie](https://youtu.be/3VG6t4Bqt8w) prepared for [Biodiversity Genomics 2020 Conference](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/biodiversity-genomics-2020/) held online in October 2020. Very importantly, we don't stick to performing de novo sequencing and are rather open to collaborating with other projects for contributing complimentary samples and analyses in order to maximize existing resources. Please find more details in [our position paper](https://doi.org/10.22541/au.162498956.63679523/v1) and a [trailer movie](https://youtu.be/_xXfpIc7l2E) prepared for [Biodiversity Genomics 2021 Conference](https://www.darwintreeoflife.org/news_item/biodiversity-genomics-2021-sequencing-genomes-across-the-planet/) held online in September/October 2021.

## Why sharks?
The taxon Elasmobranchii (sharks and rays) is one of the most long-established evolutionary lineages of vertebrates severely underrepresented in molecular-level research. This limitation is attributable to the long-standing absence of their whole genome sequence information, resulting from the elusiveness and low fecundity of those animals, as well as the large and repetitive genomes. Their peculiar body fluid composition has also hindered routine cell culturing that is required for chromosome analysis which serves as an indispensable reference for genome sequencing. 

## Our sequencing products
The resources and products from this project are accessible at or linked from [our original sequence archive](https://transcriptome.riken.jp/squalomix/). We also have an [NCBI BioProject entry](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA707598) that will host reference quality genome assemblies.

## Species
We first chose two egg-laying species, brownbanded bamboo shark (*Chiloscyllium punctatum*) and cloudy catshark (*Scyliorhinus torazame*), to facilitate sustainable sampling without sacrifices of adults as well as to fuel laboratory experimentation. Please see [this post at Nature Research Community](https://natureecoevocommunity.nature.com/posts/39600-decoding-shark-genomes-with-three-species-selected-for-different-reasons) for more details of our species choice. Currently, we are working on >10 more species for transcriptome or/and genome sequencing, and the speices list as of April 2021 is provided below (also, the list as of September 2020 available in the introductory movie linked above).

## History
The chronological information about our activity before and after the launch of the project is included below. Previously, we reported interim results of our genome analysis on three shark species (brownbanded bamboo shark, cloudy catshark, and whale shark), together with tissue-level gene expression profiles and epigenomic marks of the chromatin regulator CTCF ([Hara et al., 2018. Nat. Ecol. Evol. 2: 1761-1771](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-018-0673-5)). Please refer to the introductory paragraphs of this article in 2018 for the information about ealirer genomic studies.

## Our technical basis
For our previous publication in 2018, we produced all short read sequence data in-house at the DNA Analysis Facility operated inside the [Laboratory for Phyloinformatics, RIKEN BDR](https://www.bdr.riken.jp/en/research/labs/kuraku-s/). Our genome assembly also employed mate-pair reads produced with [our protocol guide 'iMate'](https://www.slideshare.net/xsighex/imate-protocol-guide-version-20).

More recently, we released the 'iconHi-C' (inexpensive and controllable Hi-C) protocol for adaptable Hi-C data acquisition ([Kadota et al., 2018. GigaScience 9: giz158](https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giz158)) and performed Hi-C scaffolding to obtain chromosome-scale sequences for shark genomes. The obtained sequences can now be validated with original high-fidelity karyotype data provided by our cell culture protocol for elasmobranchs ([Uno et al., 2020. Commun. Biol. 3: 652](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-01373-7)).
